# Contributing
Currently, Vectis is developed by a single part-time developer still in school. However, contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Please mention in the PR which issue(s) you are implementing. 

You can also contribute financially. Based on research, we would need around $75,000 USD to hire a full-time entry level developer, which would speed up development greatly. Both donations and profit from App Store Purchases will go towards hiring a full time developer.
